    <img src="../image/cauliflower.webp" alt="Image of cauliflower" width="300">
    <h2>One of my favorite ways to make cauliflower.</h2>
    <p>This is an excellent basic recipe to riff on, which really are the best kind. It is flexible, stands up to changes and substitutions. </p>
    <p>The cauliflower absorbed all of the sauce. It turned out perfect. One head made a full Pyrex dish. Will def. use the sauce again for potatoes and make THIS dish again.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 head cauliflower, cut into florets  </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter  </li>
        <li>1 cup chopped onion </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>1 cup milk </li>
        <li>6 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese, divided </li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper </li>
        <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg, or to taste </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add cauliflower, cover, and steam until tender, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x9-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Heat butter in a small saucepan over low heat; cook and stir onion in the melted butter until softened, about 5 minutes. Add flour; cook, stirring constantly, until mixture just starts to brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Gradually pour milk into mixture, whisking into a smooth sauce. Cook until just simmering.</li>
        <li>Remove sauce from heat and stir in half the Cheddar cheese until melted; sprinkle with pepper and nutmeg.</li>
        <li>Place steamed cauliflower in the prepared baking dish; pour cheese sauce over cauliflower. Sprinkle with remaining Cheddar cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and browned, about 25 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
