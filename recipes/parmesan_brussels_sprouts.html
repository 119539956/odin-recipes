    <h2>This is one of my favorite ways to eat Brussels Sprouts. </h2>
    <p>It was my first year cooking Christmas dinner for the family and I was just thinking of imaginative vegetables I could have! Turned out great and everyone loved them and have been cooking them ever since. Goes well with everything. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter </li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter  </li>
        <li>36 Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter  </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons shredded Parmesan cheese, or more to taste </li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a frying pan over medium heat until hot, 3 minutes. Melt 1 tablespoon butter; cook and stir garlic until fragrant, 30 seconds. Add 1 tablespoon butter and Brussels sprouts, cut-side down; cover and cook until golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes. </li>
        <li>PFlip Brussels sprouts; add 1 tablespoon butter. Cover and cook until other side is browned, about 3 more minutes. Transfer to a serving plate. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, salt, and black pepper.</li>
